# Natchez Trace

This is an minimal distributed tracing effect for Cats, inspired by earlier work done on [puretracing](https://github.com/tabdulradi/puretracing). It currently has integration with:

- [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/)
- [Honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io/)
- [OpenCensus](https://www.opencensus.io/)
- [LightStep](https://lightstep.com)

It supports

- spans
- numeric, string, and boolean fields
- swizzling to and from http headers

It does not support

- logs
- baggage

If you can make a case for either of these ideas I will consider supporting them, but they seem unnecessary to me.

The `Trace` effect looks like this:

```scala
def doStuff[F[_]: Trace]: F[Whatevs] =
  Trace[F].span("span here") {
    // Do stuff in F here. This is the extent of the span.
    // You can use the instance to:
    //  - create child spans
    //  - set data fields
    //  - extract a set of headers to pass to a remote
    //    service, which can then continue the trace
  }
```

To try it out start up [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) as your trace collector.

```
docker run -d --name jaeger \
  -e COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HTTP_PORT=9411 \
  -p 5775:5775/udp \
  -p 6831:6831/udp \
  -p 6832:6832/udp \
  -p 5778:5778 \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  -p 14268:14268 \
  -p 9411:9411 \
  jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.8
```

Now, finally, if you run the example in `modules/examples` (with `sbt examples/run`) and go to [localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686) you can then select `natchez-example` and search for traces.

To use it in your own projects (not recommended yet) you can do

```scala
// search at sonatype or central for latest version, sorry
libraryDependencies += "org.tpolecat"  %% "natchez-jaeger" % <version>
```
